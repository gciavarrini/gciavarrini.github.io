I wanted to use Google Analytics in my Hugo site hosted on GitHub Pages without
exposing my tracking ID in a public repository.

The solution? GitHub Secrets + a simple script to modify `hugo.toml` at build
time.

And guess what? It worked like a charm! ðŸ˜Ž

## The Problem: Keeping My Google Analytics ID Secret

I'm using Hugo with the [Hugoplate
template](https://github.com/zeon-studio/hugoplate), and I wanted to enable
Google Analytics tracking. Hugo makes it easy to add your Google Analytics ID in
hugo.toml:

```
[services]
[services.googleAnalytics]
ID = 'G-MEASUREMENT_ID'
```

However, since my site is publicly hosted on GitHub, I didn't want to hardcode
my Google Analytics ID in the repo. Exposing the ID isn't a major security risk,
but keeping secrets out of public repositories is always a good practice.

## The Goal

âœ… Use GitHub Secrets to store my Google Analytics ID securely.\
âœ… Inject the ID dynamically at build time in GitHub Actions.\
âœ… Ensure Hugo picks it up properly during deployment.

## The Solution

Injecting the ID in `hugo.toml` at Build Time!

### Step 1: Remove Google Analytics from hugo.toml

To allow our GitHub Actions workflow to inject the Google Analytics ID, I
removed the related section from `hugo.toml`.
```toml
[services]
[services.googleAnalytics]
ID = 'G-MEASUREMENT_ID'
```

ðŸš¨ Remove this section completely! ðŸš¨

### Step 2: Store the Secret in GitHub

I added my Google Analytics ID as a GitHub Secret:

* Go to GitHub Repository â†’ Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
* Click "New repository secret"
* Add a new secret: \
    _Name_: `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`\
    _Value_: `G-XXXXXXXXXX` (replace with your real Google Analytics ID)

### Step 3: Modify GitHub Actions Workflow

Hugoplate automatically generates a GitHub Actions workflow
(`.github/workflows/main.yml`) for building and publishing the website.

I added this step before building the Hugo site:

```yaml
- name: Inject Google Analytics ID
  env:
    GA_MEASUREMENT_ID: ${{ secrets.GA_MEASUREMENT_ID }}
  run: |
    echo "[services]" >> hugo.toml
    echo "[services.googleAnalytics]" >> hugo.toml
    echo "ID = '${GA_MEASUREMENT_ID}'" >> hugo.toml
```

How This Works:

âœ… Reads the secret from GitHub (`GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`).\
âœ… Dynamically appends the Google Analytics ID to `hugo.toml`.\
âœ… Hugo now recognizes the correct tracking
ID at build time!

## The Result: Success! ðŸŽ‰

I deployed my site, and Hugo picked up the ID as expected!

ðŸ”¥ No hardcoded secrets. ðŸ”¥ Google Analytics is running. ðŸ”¥ The repo stays clean
and secure.

Why This Approach is Awesome

âœ” Secure: Secrets are stored in GitHub Secrets, not in the repo. âœ” Simple: Just
two lines of shell script to inject the ID. âœ” Flexible: Works for any Hugo
project using hugo.toml.

## Is This the Best Approach Ever? Probably Not. But It Works. ðŸ˜Ž

Listen, I know this isn't the most sophisticated solution. A more advanced
approach might involve:

But hereâ€™s the thingâ€”this method is super simple, and it works. No extra
dependencies, no complex setup. Just a couple of lines in GitHub Actions, and
boomâ€”problem solved.

## Final Thoughts

If you're using Hugo + GitHub Pages and need Google Analytics without exposing
your tracking ID, this approach works like a charm ðŸ˜‰.
