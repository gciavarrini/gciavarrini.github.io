In this post, I'll explain how to securely use sensitive information in Hugo
site hosted on GitHub Pages without exposing it in a public repository.

## The Problem
Keeping Sensitive Information Secret When developing a Hugo site, you might need
to include sensitive information like API keys or database credentials.
Hardcoding these values in `hugo.toml` can expose them if your repository is
public. 

## The Goal
âœ… Use GitHub Secrets to store sensitive information securely.\
âœ… Inject the information dynamically at build time in GitHub Actions.\
âœ… Ensure Hugo picks it up properly during deployment. 

## The Solution 

Injecting sensitive information into `hugo.toml` at Build Time! ðŸš€

### Step 1: Remove Sensitive Information from `hugo.toml`
To allow our GitHub Actions workflow to inject the sensitive information, remove
any related sections from `hugo.toml`. For example, if you have something like:

```toml
[services] 
[services.exampleService]
secretKey = 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
```
ðŸš¨ Remove this section completely! ðŸš¨

### Step 2: Store the Secret in GitHub
Add your sensitive information as a GitHub Secret:

* Go to GitHub Repository â†’ Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
* Click "_New repository secret_"
* Add a new secret:
  *  Name: `EXAMPLE_SECRET_KEY`
  *  Value: `your_real_secret_value`

### Step 3: Modify GitHub Actions Workflow
Some Hugo templates, ie. Hugoplate, automatically generate a GitHub Actions
workflow (`.github/workflows/main.yml`) for building and publishing the website.

Add this step before building the Hugo site:

```yaml
- name: Inject Secret Key
  env: EXAMPLE_SECRET_KEY: ${{secrets.EXAMPLE_SECRET_KEY }}
  run: |
   echo "[services]" >> hugo.toml
   echo "[services.exampleService]" >> hugo.toml
   echo "secretKey = '${EXAMPLE_SECRET_KEY}'" >> hugo.toml
```

#### How This Works:
âœ… Reads the secret from GitHub (EXAMPLE_SECRET_KEY). \
âœ… Dynamically appends the secret key to `hugo.toml`.\
âœ… Hugo now recognizes the correct value at build time!

### The Result: Success! ðŸŽ‰

I deployed my site, and Hugo picked up the secret value as expected!\
ðŸ”¥ No hardcoded secrets.\
ðŸ”¥ The repository stays clean and secure.

## Why This Approach is Awesome 
âœ” **Secure**: Secrets are stored in GitHub Secrets, not in the repo.\
âœ” **Simple**: Just a few lines of shell script to inject the value.\
âœ” **Flexible**: Works for any Hugo project using `hugo.toml`.

## Final Thoughts 
If you're using Hugo + GitHub Pages and need to handle sensitive information
without exposing it, this approach works effectively. Let me know if you found
this useful or have any questions! ðŸš€
