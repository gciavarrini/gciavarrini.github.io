## Abstract
Do you have a Raspberry Pi and want to learn about a cool way to use your
devices and a Kubernetes cluster? During this talk, Jakub and I will introduce
you to Project Flotta. We will demonstrate how to register your devices within a
Kubernetes cluster and how to deploy containerized workloads.

You can’t imagine how easy it is to access cameras or other sensors available on
your device fleet, collect data from them, and then transfer it from an edge
device to a cluster using the Flotta Project
([project-flotta.io](https://project-flotta.io/))!

At the end of the presentation, you will be able to make your distributed
collected data sets available in one central location. You will also learn how
to monitor your devices using Flotta's built-in metrics and logs collection
mechanisms, which will allow you to gain good insights into how your workloads
perform.
