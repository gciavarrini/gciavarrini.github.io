Hello! I’m Gloria Ciavarrini, a Senior Software Engineer at Red Hat,
based in beautiful Pisa, Italy. 


My journey in computer engineering has been both exciting and rewarding, and
I’m thrilled to share a bit about myself with you. I earned my PhD in Computer
Engineering from the University of Pisa, where I delved into smartphone based 
IP addresses geolocation techniques. 

It’s incredibly fulfilling to work on open-source projects that make a real
difference in people’s lives. 

It’s incredibly fulfilling to work on open-source projects that make a real
difference in people’s lives. I am also passionate about embracing diversity in
technology and actively seek to empower other women in STEM fields. I believe
that diverse perspectives lead to more innovative solutions and a more inclusive
tech community.

When I'm not coding or brainstorming new ideas, I love sharing my knowledge
through talks and presentations. It’s important to me to foster discussions that
lead to creative solutions and inspire others.

One of my favorite ways to unwind is by taking my RV out for adventures along the coast.
There’s nothing quite like working in front of the sea, feeling the breeze while I dive
into my projects. Whether it’s a beachside café or a peaceful spot by the waves, I find
that nature fuels my creativity and keeps me inspired.

I’d love to connect with you! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just 
want to chat about technology, or anything else that sparks your interest.
